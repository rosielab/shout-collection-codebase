        title: 'Task Details',
        body: 'You are invited to take part in our collection of shout and scream data. We will be collecting some demographic data to help us understand your voice. Participants will read from a script while moving their phone to various positions around their home. This data will be used in projects to help us detect screams and shouts in two projects. The first is an app being built in conjunction with the non-profit organization Haiven that detects and flags shouted speech from recordings to help those living with intimate partner violence track potentially problematic situations that can later be manually annotated by the user. The second is to detect which emotion is being expressed through shouts so that robot agents can better adapt their behaviour to the current context.',

        title: 'Voluntary Participation and Right to Withdraw',
        body: 'Your participation is entirely voluntary. You may end your participation at any point without penalty by stopping your recording and not returning it to the researchers. However, once you have submitted your data it will not be possible to withdraw from the study as the data is stored without collection of your name or contact information. If you are participating in person you may ask the researcher to stop collection at any time.',

        title: 'Procedures',
        body: "Upon agreeing to this consent form, follow the steps provided by hitting 'next'. Be aware of any disturbances you may contribute to your surroundings. Please begin by filling out the pre-study questionnaire. Next, following the study instructions you will be recording yourself speaking, shouting and screaming several phrases with your phone in different positions around your home. The collection should take approximately 30 minutes. Collection may be done in your own home, or by scheduling a time by emailing ptuttosi@sfu.ca to come in person to either SFU Surrey or Burnaby for assistance and collection of the data.",

        title: 'Data Retention',
        body: "Data provided will be stored in a database for the use of future researchers. The data will be stored in ROSIE's Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket on Canadian servers until the data collection has concluded. Following this the data will be transferred to SFU Vault and the researcher's local computers for the duration of the research. Once research has concluded the data will be destroyed from any local devices and will be stored in the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) free to use for research purposes. Commercial use of the data will be provided to Haiven for their use in developing applications to improve the lives of those living with intimate partner violence. No other commercial use will be available.",

        title: 'Risks/Discomforts',
        body: 'We do not think there is anything in this study that could harm you. It should be noted that this study will involve the need to repeatedly yell random phrases such as "banana and mustard sandwiches", if you are concerned that this may cause your neighbours distress or result in punitive action please make them aware and check your surroundings before participating in the study. We suggest that you schedule a time with the researchers by emailing ptuttosi@sfu.ca to complete your participation in person at SFU if you are concerned about your ability to scream in your own home as neither Haiven nor ROSIE Lab will be held responsible for repercussions of this activity.',

        title: 'Benefits',
        body: 'Although it may not directly benefit you, this study will benefit society by providing data for researchers understanding screams and the emotions they convey. Future use cases include scream and shout detection in applications monitoring violence and improving robots abilities to adapt to human emotions or distress.',

        body: "In this study, we will collect your age group, sex, gender, first language learned and current primary language. However, no directly identifying data (e.g. name, e-mail address) will be stored along with your responses. We note that your voice will be used, and this could potentially be identifiable. Voice recordings will only be accessible by research personnel and will be securely stored as per designated in 'Data Retention'. All email correspondence will be permanently deleted once the conversation has concluded.",
